## [1.2.5] - 2025-08-03

### 🎉 **PRODUCTION READY - Complete TypeScript & API Compatibility**

This is a **major stability release** that resolves all TypeScript type mismatches and makes the SDK fully functional with the real Brale API. The SDK is now production-ready and CLI-compatible.

#### 🔧 **Critical API Fixes**
- **BREAKING FIX**: Resolved API 500 errors by removing problematic `Accept: application/json` header
- **AccountsService**: Updated to return `string[]` matching actual `/accounts` endpoint response
- **AddressesService**: Complete rewrite to handle JSON:API format with `data` and `attributes` structure
- **Authentication**: Confirmed OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow works perfectly with production API
- **Error handling**: Enhanced with specific messages for 400, 401, 403, 404, 429, 500, 503 status codes

#### 🏗️ **TypeScript Type System Overhaul**
- **AddressType enum**: Fixed values to match API (`CUSTODIAL` → `custodial`, `EXTERNALLY_OWNED` → `externally-owned`)
- **Network enum**: Added comprehensive support for 25+ blockchain networks (EVM mainnets, testnets, Solana, Stellar, Hedera, Coreum, Canton)
- **ApiAddress model**: New JSON:API compliant model with proper `attributes` and `links` structure
- **Service return types**: All services now return types that match actual API responses
- **Import/export conflicts**: Resolved with explicit exports to avoid naming collisions

#### 🔄 **Brale CLI Compatibility**
- **Pattern analysis**: Studied [official Brale CLI](https://github.com/Brale-xyz/cli) and aligned SDK behavior
- **Command equivalents**: `brale accounts` ≡ `client.accounts.list()`, `brale internal-wallets` ≡ filtered addresses
- **Network support**: Validated against CLI documentation (ethereum, base, polygon, arbitrum, etc.)
- **Transfer patterns**: Aligned with CLI's 4-argument structure (amount, address, value-type, transfer-type)

#### 🧪 **Comprehensive Real-World Testing**
- **CLI Pattern Validation**: 8 tests confirming SDK matches CLI behavior
- **Fixed SDK Validation**: 12 tests validating all type fixes work with real API  
- **Real API Integration**: 10 tests with direct API response validation
- **Live API testing**: Validated with production credentials against 70+ addresses, 2 accounts, 25+ networks
- **Error scenarios**: Tested 404, authentication failures, and server errors

#### 📊 **Infrastructure Improvements**
- **User-Agent**: Updated to `BraleSDK/1.2.5` for better API tracking
- **Debug capabilities**: Enhanced logging and error reporting for troubleshooting
- **Documentation**: Added `SDK_ANALYSIS_AND_LEARNINGS.md` with API response analysis
- **Test coverage**: Added 30+ integration tests with real API validation

#### 🚀 **Migration Guide**
```typescript
// OLD (v1.2.4) - Broken
const accounts = await client.accounts.list();
console.log(accounts.data); // ❌ TypeError: undefined

// NEW (v1.2.5) - Working
const accounts = await client.accounts.list();
console.log(accounts); // ✅ ['account-id-1', 'account-id-2']

// OLD (v1.2.4) - Type errors
const addresses = await client.addresses.list();
addresses.data.forEach(addr => addr.type); // ❌ Property 'type' missing

// NEW (v1.2.5) - Fully typed
const addresses = await client.addresses.list();
addresses.data.forEach(addr => addr.attributes.type); // ✅ 'custodial' | 'externally-owned'
```

**This release transforms the SDK from "very close to being fully functional" to "production-ready and CLI-compatible".**
